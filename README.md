###TSL - Wall App Info
Wall App is a website that allows users to register and login.  After registering they receive a welcome email.  After logging in a user can post messages on the site-wide wall, similar to a facebook wall except there is only 1 wall for the entire site.  Guests as well as other users can see all of the messages on the wall.  These are the minimum requirements.  You are free to add any additional features you like.

Note: a lot of the finer details are left out of this description, do whatever you think would make sense.  You are being judged on code and API design, not on how useful or interesting you make the app.  If you do however find a way to make it interesting, thatâ€™s a bonus!

####Tech Info
 Backend: Django REST API

 Frontend: AJAX based website (e.g. using React or Angular)

Backend and frontend should be completely separate apps, i.e. the django backend does not render any html pages for the frontend.
